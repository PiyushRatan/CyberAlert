# CyberAlert
A beginner-friendly yet ambitious cybersecurity tool that helps detect scam messages. Currently built with HTML, CSS, and Python. Planned upgrades include:

- Flask backend for message processing 🔁
- JavaScript for enhanced interactivity 💡
- Machine Learning model for real-time scam detection 🧠
- Clean UI/UX for mobile and desktop users 🌐

This project is part of a Devpost Hackathon and grows as I learn — from frontend to full-stack, from static to smart.
